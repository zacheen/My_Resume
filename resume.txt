EXPERIENCE
Apollo Medical Optics, Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan         May 2022 - August 2023
Algorithm Engineer
* Developed cell detection algorithms for OCT images in C++ and translated team's code from MATLAB to C++
* Optimized the code to balance accuracy and execution speed, resulting in several related research publications
* As a contact person for the clinical department, assisted colleagues in avoiding tedious work by creating elegant solutions using C#
* Managed a 3D dense segmentation project and achieved an accuracy of 80% by adopting post-processing rules
* Discovered illogical code in the image preprocessing procedure while writing specifications, and created a program that automatically adjusts the parameters to align the modification


Future Tech, Taipei, Taiwan        
Backend Engineer        August 2021 - March 2022
* Used Lua to develop four games integrated into the backend server, by implementing game logic and computer AI reactions, connecting the backend server to both the frontend and the website's backstage through RPC and API, computing game results, and saving them in the database
* Optimized the server by balancing the usage of each database server through a new hash function, increasing player capacity by 20%
* Updated server management tools: deployed and managed Nginx servers in a Docker environment, configured server connection, and integrated Redis with MySQL to improve performance through asynchronous databases
Automated Testing Engineer        July 2020 - August 2021
* Developed a fully automated testing library to detect game flows and play games automatically with OpenCV and PyAutoGUI, identify screen information through object detection, check game logic to compare its data from the frontend to the website's backstage, and generate test reports in HTML
* Enhanced test coverage by extracting information with Machine Learning and training three partners in Python through generating questionnaires and examples
* Represented automated testing as the main programmer (on a business trip??): confirmed that the online website was updated successfully, discussed the priorities for each test case with the project manager, and listed the testing time of each game after introducing automated testing
